Verity - If you didn’t have a connection to him, like you say, I would believe you. 
Verity - It wouldn’t make sense for you to kill Matthew Murphy.
Claire - Thank you for your encouraging words. I knew I could trust you to see things my way.
Verity - But you do have a connection with him, don’t you?
Claire - ......
Claire - No? I already said I don’t.
Verity - Maybe Claire Steele didn’t...
Verity - ...but The Catalyst definitely does!
Claire - What! That’s crazy! I-I mean... That’s preposterous! 
Verity - Mr. Murphy was looking for the true identity of The Catalyst.
Verity - This means that you had a motive to kill him, you had to stop him from revealing your identity!
Claire - B-but I... I had no idea he was doing that. I promise!
Verity - <think>(Is she playing dumb or did she really not know?)<>
Ace - Care to fill me in on what he knew about The Catalyst?
Verity - He had a few suspects. The one that’s most important to us at this moment is Ramsey Paige.
Ace - Now that you mention it... that makes a whole lot of sense.
Ace - Both have a criminal background and haven’t been seen for 5 years. 
Wren - Actually, Ramsey was seen 4 months ago.
Amara - He was?
Wren - He was the one who caused the crash that put Wilma in a coma.
Claire - <shake>WHAAAAAAAAAAAT!!!<>
Verity - <think>(She didn’t know that either?)<>
Rook - I was hoping to use that as a trump card later on, but oh well. 
Claire - Ramsey was the one in that car!?
Rook - He was. Which gives you a motive to kill him too.
Claire - <shake>But I had no idea it was him!<>
Wren - You didn’t?
Ace - She did mention that the person in the other car ran away before she could see them.
Rook - I don’t believe that for a second.
Verity - <think>(She really didn’t know...)<>
Claire - But I didn’t know! I would never kill anyone!
Rook - All the evidence suggests otherwise.
Claire - Th-then maybe you missed something! Something clue I-I forgot to get rid of. Some blood I forgot to clean up. 
Verity - We searched all of the main room of Arthur’s Hall of Oddities. We found nothing of the sort.
Claire - <shake>That’s it!<> There could be stuff in the other rooms that you missed. Proof I didn’t kill anyone!
Amara - The other rooms? You mean the Hall family residence?
Claire - Exactly!
Verity - Hall family? As in Dr. Minerva Hall?
Ace - Yes. She’s married to the museum's curator, Arthur Hall.
Verity - <think>(I hate how interconnected these two cases are. It’s making my head hurt.)<>
Wren - Does that mean another Aguilar family adventure?
Rook - Seems like it.
Verity - Wren, we’re still not related.
Wren - A guy can dream.
Ace - Before you go, I’d like to have a word with you, Mr. Aguilar.
Rook - Can this wait?
Ace - Sadly, no.
Wren - So we’re just down to two?
Amara - I can’t let two civilians wander around a crime scene unsupervised. I’ll come along to keep an eye on you.
Verity - <think>(This will either be an amazing or terrible experience and that terrifies me.)<>
Ace - Let’s leave them to it Mr. Aguilar. 
Rook - Alright.
Rook - Pssst, Verity.
Verity - Why are we whispering?
Rook - Hold onto this for me.
[gain The Device]
Verity - Is this...?
Rook - Wren will tell you how to use it.
Ace - Are you coming or not?
Rook - Right behind you.
Verity - <think>(Why did he give me his secret weapon?)<>
Verity - <think>(He usually keeps it on him at all times. Why not now?)<>
Amara - We should head out too.
Wren - This will be interesting.
