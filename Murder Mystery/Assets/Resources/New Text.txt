Amara - You have a lot of butterfly themed stuff in your room.
Feyme - They are my favorite.
Verity - Where did you get them? I don’t think I’ve ever seen any store sell them.
Feyme - I got papa to get people to make them for me. 
Wren - So they were custom made.
Feyme - They don’t look how I wanted them to look but it is okay. I didn’t want to tell them to make it again.
Amara - You seemed to have a clear vision of what you wanted the butterflies to look like.
Feyme - Yeah, I wanted them to be perfect but this is okay I guess.
