Verity - I can’t find any fault in her statement.
Claire - <shake>FINALLY!!!<>
Claire - You finally admit that there is no reason to suspect me!
Verity - Well... my entire case hinges on you <float>not<> being here.
Claire - Then we agree!
Amara - Aguilar was the one who accused Steele of being the culprit in this case.
Verity - Then my intuition must have been wrong, I guess?
Ace - That’s all it takes for your “unwavering” determination to waver? You were so sure a few minutes ago.
Rook - If your gut is telling you she is behind the museum case, then run with that. 
Rook - It doesn’t mean she couldn’t be behind both.
Claire - In all my years of existence, I have not killed a single person, <shake>let alone two!<>
Rook - That’s still up for debate.
Claire - It shouldn’t be!
Rook - I think we are lacking in information at the moment.
Amara - You’ve already exhausted all the information you could get from everyone who was here.
Rook - Not <float>everyone.<> There is one person involved in this case that we haven’t gotten any information from.
Wren - Who? The victim?
Rook - Exactly!
Wren - No, I... I was joking.
Amara - How do you expect to learn more about him? He’s dead.
Ace - You have heard the saying “dead men tell no tales”, I presume?
Rook - We can head to his office. There is bound to be a clue or two to be found there.
Verity - You know where his office is?
Rook - Yes, I’ve visited it a few times. I can show you the way.
Wren - Aguilar family adventure!
Ace - You guys have fun!
Verity - You aren’t coming with?
Ace - No, sadly. I’d love to spend some time with my honorary protege but I have a few things I need to discuss with my official protege.
Verity - I’m not your “protege”!
Ace - Whatever you say honorary protege.
Amara - See you later Ve...
Amara - Goodbye Chase.
Verity - ......
Verity - Bye Amara...
