Verity - Wait a minute! Let me check something...
Wren - What are you checkin’?
Verity - If the case file from the safe has a corresponding trial record.
Rook - And?
Verity - It’s not here...
Verity - So this must be a backup of the trial record that was stolen!
Wren - Why would someone steal that specific one?
Rook - Maybe there was some information in it that the thief didn’t want to get out.
Wren - But why now and not 5 years ago?
Verity - No idea...
Rook - In any case I think I have narrowed down the suspect list for the break in down to two.
Verity - You have?
Rook - It had to be someone related to the case. Someone with information about them that they’d like to keep hidden.
Rook - In addition, it has to be someone who has been gone for the past 5 years.
Verity - I think I know who you’re thinking of.
Verity - It’s The Catalyst and Ramsey, right?
Rook - You’re exactly right. 
Rook - Both of them are mentioned in this file and both have been gone for 5 years, explaining why they didn’t steal the files earlier.
Wren - What does this mean exactly?
Rook - This means we need to have another chat with our eccentric vigilante once more.
Verity - Alright! Let’s go.
