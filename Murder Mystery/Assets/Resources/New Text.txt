Wren - We’re back! Again...
Ace - Did you three have a good time?
Verity - ...Yeah! We did.
Rook - Did you also find any clues?
Amara - Steele’s blood was found in one of the Hall family’s rooms. We believe that is the real crime scene.
Ace - Excellent work everyone! I knew I could count on you to find it.
Verity - <think>(Did he know about that too?!)<>
Wren - Turns out that both Claire and Ramsey couldn’t be The Catalyst.
Ace - I already knew Ms. Steele wasn’t The Catalyst.
Verity - Really?
Ace - You expected me to believe that The Catalyst who has been evading law enforcement and Interpol for 4 years before going into hiding for 5 was the 20 year old Claire Steele. 
Ace - She would have been 11 years old when she donned the suit.
Verity - Well I didn’t know all the stuff you just told me.
Ace - And yet your mission was to capture the Catalyst.
Verity - <think>(I got too excited about my first solo case that I forgot to do any research.)<>
Rook - We should probably confront Ms. Steele about this revelation. 
Verity - We did find evidence of you being in the museum during the time of the murder.
Claire - <shake>Yes!!!<> Thank you!
Verity - But that doesn’t make it impossible for you to have committed the one here too.
Claire - Oh, come <shake>ON!!!<> 
Wren - We also found out you aren’t the same Catalyst from 5 years ago.
Claire - I-I-I... Y-you have no proof...?
Amara - No need for all that. Just admit it.
Claire - B-but...
Rook - I <float>highly<> doubt you were 11 years old when you started your vigilante career.
Claire - *sigh* <float>Fiiiiiiine.<> I’m... not the real Catalyst. I just made a copy of the outfit based on public photos I could find.
Verity - <think>(Explains why the mask looked different.)<>
Claire - Now that you’ve found me out, I guess we’re done here.
Rook - Not so fast.
Rook - Just because you’re not the real Catalyst, doesn’t mean you aren’t the real culprit.
Claire - Are we still on that? I wasn’t even here last night!
Rook - You keep saying that and I keep not believing you.
???F - Please don’t be mean to her. She doesn’t deserve this. 
Verity - Who said that?
Wilma - That was me.
Claire - <shake>Wilma!?<> Y-you’re awake…!
