Verity - Alright, you win.
Verity - Let her go and we won’t follow you.
Minerva - Smart choice.
Minerva - Aguilar. 
Rook - Yes?
Minerva - I’ll be back for my device.
[minerva escapes]
Mari - *pant* *pant* *pant*
Mari - <shake>I COULD HAVE DIED!!!<>
Ace - What’s going on? We heard a commotion and got here as fast as we could.
Rook - Good news is that we found the culprit behind Mr. Murphy’s death.
Ace - I’m assuming there is bad news too?
Rook - She... escaped.
Ace - <shake>WHAT!<>
Verity - Dr. Hall escaped through the window after confessing to everything.
Ace - You let the culprit get away again? I can’t trust you with anything can I?
Ace - Dispatch as many officers you can get. Blockade all major exits and chokepoints. 
Ace - <shake>Don’t let her get away!<>
Amara - Verity, you seem a bit shaken. Are you okay?
Verity - Yeah. Thanks for checking up on me. 
Amara - That’s what friends are for.
Ace - So Dr. Hall was behind this whole thing, huh?
Verity - Yeah, I guess Claire really wasn’t the true culprit.
Rook - Seems like I was right between the two of us. Seems like your intuition isn’t as good as it’s cracked up to be.
Verity - Y-yeah... <think>(He’s right. It doesn’t matter how much I improve. He’ll always be better than me.)<>
Rook - Our job’s not done yet. We still have another murder to solve.
Amara - Right, lead the way.
Ace - I’ll stay here for a bit to wrap things up and get everyone's statements. Hold down the fort for me Ms. Phoenix.
Amara - Of course. 
Verity - Before we go. Wren, what happened back there? 
Verity - You just shouted out in pain the moment Dr. Hall took Mari hostage.
Wren - I had another vision.
Verity - I’m sorry, what?
Wren - I’ve never been this close to the actual thing.
Wren - I could see myself.
Wren - It was weird.
Verity - This isn’t another joke, right?
Wren - No, I promise it isn’t.
Wren - I dunno how I’m able to have these visions or even why I have them in the first place.
Wren - My mom had them too but she won’t talk to me and dad doesn’t like when I bring her up.
Verity - ...
Wren - Sorry... I just need a minute.
Verity - Alright. I believe you. 
Wren - ...
Wren - I just wish I could see things <important>before they happen...<>
Wren - Then maybe I could’ve stopped all this from happening.
